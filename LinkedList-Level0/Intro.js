//Linear Data Stracture
//Nodes are Linked together by a reference field

//Two types of Linked lists:-

//1.Singly Linked list
//2.Doubly Linked list

//Diffrence b/w Linked List and Array

//Linked List                          ||                      //Array 
//1.Linear                                                     Linear
//2.Contigeous                                                 Non-Contigeous
//3.Dynamic Size(Chnage Easily)                                Fixed Size
//4.Node = (Value+Pointers)                                    Just Value
//5.Fetching element is hard 0(n)                              Fetching element is easy 0(1)
//6.Insertion/Deletion easy                                    Insertion/Deletion Hard
//7.Extra Memory                                               Memory Efficient 

//UseCases

//When to use what
//1.Access elelements by fast -Use Array
//2.Memory Efficient storage for static size -Use Array

//3.Insert/Delete  Head/Tail frequently -- Linked list
//4.Avoid resizing overhead or unknown size upfront --Linked List
//5.Do lots of Traversal/Manipulation -- Linked list
